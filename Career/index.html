<h1>Beginning Of my Tech Career</h1>
<p>NAME:Emmanuel Mbam Nwogha</p>
<p>ALT SCHOOL ID:ALT/SOE/023/2009</p>
<br><br>
<h2>Biography</h2>
<p>I am the last child of my parents, a family of eleven(11).
    I have always been amazed by computers,
    from the simple calculators to the more complex super computers and the movies watered it down.
    Growing up, I wanted nothing more than to be proficient with computers; 
    you need to see how happy I was when I wrote my first code.<br><br>
    <h2>Journey Through Altschool</h2>
    
    I didn’t think it twice when the opportunity to join alt school presented itself,
    I first heard about alt school from the cloudfairy on twitter; she narrated her journey through alt school
    and it felt very pleasing and doable, and so I applied and passed the assessment on the first attempt  with an 86% score.
    Alt school is the absolute best, I knew nothing about html but can write it after just one class(albeit not so well). 
    The teaching scheme is great and easygoing and I’m very happy to be doing this.
    <h2>Career Path</h2>
    
    I am studying to become a cloud engineer, it’s a career path that I didn’t know existed but after reading about what it entails, <br>
    I completely fell in love with it.
    I am hoping to be very proficient in this field, create amazing things and help profer solutions to issues.</p>
